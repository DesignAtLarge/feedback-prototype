The extension is for facilitating grading and some data collections
 You can download the extension here and unzip the zipfile, then
 in the chrome extension page (chrome:/extensions), select "load unpacked"
 and load the extension to your chrome extension browser.
 Or you can find the extension in the chrome store (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/feedback-prototype/nnkffffggnpbahijipfeddnmdbimobmb)
 but it might not be the latest version, new version would be first pushed to github then update on
 chrome store.
